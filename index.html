      <tr><td class="tg-0lax">It usually impacts on maintainability the presence of code smells, when the time of modify the existing code arrives, code smells make that changes easy to break the code. I don't mark this as very harmful because it is preferable a well tested code with some code smells that a non tested software without code smells.</td></tr>

      <tr><td class="tg-0lax">Code smells make software readability and comprehensibility worse. That itself already degrade software quality. Moreover, code smells can make it harder to find bugs in the software, since you can only find bugs in code that you can read, and understand.</td></tr>

      <tr><td class="tg-0lax">I do believe that code smells are harmful, but not usually harmful. There are specific cases that make them harmful, for example, when specific types of smells (or from similar categories) co-occur together. For instance, if a class contains a God Class, Intensive Coupling (or Dispersed Coupling) and more than one Feature Envy, in this case, the smells are harmful since they indicate that the class has a bigger structural problem. On the other hand, there are cases that smells are not harmful, for example, when a class has Lazy Class.</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="tg-0lax">I believe that if you have unit test around it, it'd be Harmful or even Somewhat Harmful. Usually code smell is easy to be refactored when you have unit test.</td></tr>

Sometimes, when you have a method or function too long, normally this is related to centrilize many tasks in only one place and that method/function is being responsible for activities that actually shouldn't be its responsibility.

     <tr><td>CBO (Coupling between objects)</td><td>Counts the number of dependencies a class has. The tools checks for any type used in the entire class (field declaration, method return types, variable declarations, etc). It ignores dependencies to Java itself (e.g. java.lang.String).</td></tr>
     <tr><td>DIT (Depth Inheritance Tree)</td><td>It counts the number of "fathers" a class has. All classes have DIT at least 1 (everyone inherits java.lang.Object). In order to make it happen, classes must exist in the project (i.e. if a class depends upon X which relies in a jar/dependency file, and X depends upon other classes, DIT is counted as 2).</td></tr>
     <tr><td>Number of fields</td><td>Counts the number of fields. Specific numbers for total number of fields, static, public, private, protected, default, final, and synchronized fields.</td></tr>
     <tr><td>Number of methods</td><td>Counts the number of methods. Specific numbers for total number of methods, static, public, abstract, private, protected, default, final, and synchronized methods.</td></tr>
     <tr><td>NOSI (Number of static invocations)</td><td>Counts the number of invocations to static methods. It can only count the ones that can be resolved by the JDT.</td></tr>
     <tr><td>RFC (Response for a Class)</td><td>Counts the number of unique method invocations in a class. As invocations are resolved via static analysis, this implementation fails when a method has overloads with same number of parameters, but different types.</td></tr>
     <tr><td>WMC (Weight Method Class) or McCabe's complexity</td><td>It counts the number of branch instructions in a class.</td></tr>
     <tr><td>LOC (Lines of code)</td><td>It counts the lines of count, ignoring empty lines.</td></tr>
     <tr><td>LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods)</td><td>Calculates LCOM metric. This is the very first version of metric, which is not reliable. LCOM-HS can be better (hopefully, you will send us a pull request).</td></tr>
     <tr><td>Quantity of returns</td><td>The number of return instructions.</td></tr>
     <tr><td>Quantity of loops</td><td>The number of loops (i.e., for, while, do while, enhanced for).</td></tr>
     <tr><td>Quantity of comparisons</td><td>The number of comparisons (i.e., ==).</td></tr>
     <tr><td>Quantity of try/catches</td><td>The number of try/catches.</td></tr>
     <tr><td>Quantity of parenthesized expressions</td><td>The number of expressions inside parenthesis.</td></tr>
     <tr><td>String literals</td><td>The number of string literals (e.g., "John Doe"). Repeated strings count as many times as they appear.</td></tr>
     <tr><td>Quantity of Number</td><td>The number of numbers (i.e., int, long, double, float) literals.</td></tr>
     <tr><td>Quantity of Math Operations</td><td>The number of math operations (times, divide, remainder, plus, minus, left shit, right shift).</td></tr>
     <tr><td>Quantity of Variables</td><td>Number of declared variables.</td></tr>
     <tr><td>Max nested blocks</td><td>The highest number of blocks nested together.</td></tr>
     <tr><td>Quantity of Anonymous classes, subclasses, and lambda expressions</td><td>The Quantity of Anonymous classes, subclasses, and lambda expressions.</td></tr>
     <tr><td>Number of unique words</td><td>Number of unique words in the source code. See WordCounter class for details on the implementation.</td></tr>
